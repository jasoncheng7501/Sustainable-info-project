<h1>Run descriptive statistics</h1>

<aside>
    <p>Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, perc_enjoy is much higher on average than perc_usefulness, which also has a large variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.</p>
</aside>

<div class = "body">
<p>Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with <strong style=color:blue>continuous</strong> values, are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness, and perc_ease_of_use are already adjacent.) Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.</p>
</div>

<div class ="listNextToBox">
    <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Tools &lt; Add-Ins...</strong> and make sure <strong>Analysis ToolPak</strong> is checked. Click OK.</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Tools &lt; Data Analysis</strong> and select <strong>Descriptive Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
        <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <strong>Summary Statistics</strong>. Click OK.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class = "body">
<p>The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, Column 1 should be perc_enjoy. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4. Analyzing descriptive statistics is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics for perc_usefulness and perc_ease_of_use?</p>
